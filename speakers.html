								<p>Julia Neidhardt is a researcher at the E-Commerce Research Unit at TU Wien, Austria.
								She holds a Master's degree in mathematics from the University of Vienna and a PhD in
								computer science from TU Wien. Her research focuses on modeling and predicting
								complex human behavior, user opinions, preferences and social relations as well as their
								dynamics in digital-enabled environments. In recent projects, she studied social
								influence mechanism in online communities, the diffusion of topics, opinions and
								sentiments, social media-based event prediction, team performance, news
								recommender systems as well as picture-based travel recommender systems. Since
								2013, she has been a regular visiting researcher at the Science of Networks in
								Communities (SONIC) research group at Northwestern University, USA. Her work is
